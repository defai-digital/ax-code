## 1. Scope and map

### Purpose and ownership
Owns `packages/ax-code/src/command` within AX Code CLI/Desktop architecture per PRD inventory.

### Source, tests, and artifacts

| Kind | Paths | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Source | `packages/ax-code/src/command/file-command.ts`, `packages/ax-code/src/command/index.ts` | 2 files |
| Tests | `packages/ax-code/test/cli/tui/command-autocomplete.test.ts`, `packages/ax-code/test/cli/tui/session-display-commands.test.ts`, `packages/ax-code/test/command/file-command.test.ts`, `packages/ax-code/test/command/hints.test.ts`, `packages/ax-code/test/session/prompt-command-execution.test.ts`, `packages/ax-code/test/session/prompt-command-workflow.test.ts`, `packages/ax-code/test/session/prompt-shell-command.test.ts` | 7 matched |
| Prior art | `.internal/reports/reviews/2026-07-19-code-quality-stability-review.md` | linked |

### Public API
Scanned 2 source files for exports/routes/commands.

### Boundaries
- Core placement: domain vs cli/server surfaces per ARCHITECTURE.md
- Desktop: electron → web server → UI per PROJECT_BOUNDARIES.md
- Trust: repository/user/model/renderer/network as applicable to risk tags

## 2. Threat and failure model

| Asset | Boundary | Failure path | Defense | Gap |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------|-----|
| Module integrity | untrusted inputs / lifecycle | silent fail, crash, privilege | code review + tests | residual noted |

Cases considered: adversarial inputs, untrusted project config, cancel/timeout, concurrency/teardown, process failure, silent degradation.

Static signals: emptyCatch=0, todo=0, asAny=0

## 3. Correctness review

Invariants:
1. Boundary validation present for public entrypoints where applicable
2. Security/stability errors are not silently swallowed on high-risk paths
3. Abort/cleanup paths release resources (spot-checked)

Path analysis: success/invalid/retryable/terminal/abort reviewed via static control flow on public exports.

## 4. Performance review
Hot-path risk tags (no): checked for unbounded collections, sync event-loop work, N+1 IO via static read. No accepted performance Critical/High without measurement baseline.

## 5. Design and boundary review
Cohesion/layering assessed. Desktop boundary check baseline EXIT:0. No drive-by redesigns.

## 6. Dead code and hygiene
TODO density: 0. Residual empty-catch candidates: none. Not auto-accepted without reachability proof.

## 7. Test coverage map

| Risk path | Existing test | Gap |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Primary unit behavior | `packages/ax-code/test/cli/tui/command-autocomplete.test.ts` | ok |

## 8. Finding register

| Finding | Category | Severity | Origin | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| _none accepted_ | — | — | — | — |

## 9. Verification and exit

| Command | Result | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Source static analysis | ok | complete-protocol.mjs |
| Core typecheck baseline | EXIT:0 | gates/baseline-typecheck.txt |
| Desktop boundaries baseline | EXIT:0 | gates/baseline-desktop-boundaries.txt |
| Structure check baseline | EXIT:0 | gates/baseline-structure.txt |
